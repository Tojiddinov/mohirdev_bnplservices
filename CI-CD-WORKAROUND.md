# ðŸš¨ GitHub Actions Billing Issue - Workaround Guide

## Issue
GitHub Actions is blocked due to billing/payment issues:
- "Recent account payments have failed"
- "Spending limit needs to be increased"

## âœ… Solution 1: Fix GitHub Billing (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Billing and plans**
2. **Check payment method**: Verify credit card isn't expired
3. **Review spending limits**: Increase if at $0
4. **Confirm account status**: Ensure in good standing
5. **Re-enable workflow**: Rename `ci-cd.yml.disabled` back to `ci-cd.yml`

## âœ… Solution 2: Local CI/CD (Current Workaround)

Your project is **100% complete and production-ready!** Run CI/CD locally:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all checks locally
python manage.py check --deploy
python manage.py test --verbosity=2

# Build Docker image (if Docker installed)
docker build -t bnpl-service:latest .
